            <p>As I wrap up my summer internship at Lennox International Inc., I can confidently say this experience was more than just an internship—it was a hands-on immersion into building real-world, impactful AI systems. Over the past few months, I worked alongside brilliant minds across engineering and product teams, contributing not as an intern on the sidelines, but as an active, empowered member of the team.</p>

            <h2>Forecasting the Future with Transformers</h2>
            <p>My primary project centered around building a multivariate time-series forecasting model using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). The goal was to predict HVAC system usage and optimal setpoints across varying home environments—factoring in features like weather, past usage patterns, and sensor data. With this model, we aimed to increase both user comfort and energy efficiency, directly impacting product adoption and user satisfaction.</p>

            <p>The challenge wasn't just in building the model, but also in adapting it for edge deployment. We had to rigorously test the model on thermostat devices with limited memory and compute power, requiring optimization and iterative tuning. Working closely with the control engineering team, I gained an appreciation for hardware constraints and real-time system behavior. Simultaneously, I collaborated with the product management team to align model outputs with user expectations and interface capabilities.</p>

            <p>This cross-functional collaboration taught me how data science integrates with systems engineering and product vision. I wasn't just building a model—I was helping to shape a smarter, more responsive product.</p>

            <h2>Hit the Ground Running—Literally</h2>
            <p>What surprised me the most was how quickly I was welcomed into the core workflow. By Week 2, I was already giving demos of the feature pipeline I'd built—walking the team through preprocessing steps, model behavior, and real-time outputs. The trust the team placed in me meant a lot, and it inspired me to deliver with both confidence and accountability.</p>

            <p>Midway through the internship, we transitioned to using Databricks for model development and deployment. I played a key role in setting up automated data pipelines, feature engineering workflows, and versioned model tracking, streamlining our path to production and improving the maintainability of our forecasting system.</p>

            <h2>More Than Just a Workplace</h2>
            <p>The culture at Lennox stood out just as much as the technical work. The team was incredibly supportive and collaborative—offering guidance, feedback, and encouragement at every step. It never felt like I was "just an intern." I was treated like a full-time contributor, involved in sprint planning, design discussions, and model deployment decisions.</p>

            <p>A special part of my experience was my weekly 1:1s with my intern buddy, Kristin Antoinette Howard, a UX designer. Our conversations went beyond day-to-day work—we discussed workplace culture, ethics in tech, and the importance of inclusive design. Her perspective broadened my understanding of user-centric thinking and reinforced the value of cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

            <p>I also forged meaningful friendships with fellow interns—across data, engineering, and product teams. Whether we were grabbing lunch together or hanging out after hours, those connections made the summer feel whole.</p>

            <p>And of course, I can't forget the Q2 department event at Top Golf. Even though I wasn't exactly a Top Golf pro (far from it!), it was a blast getting to celebrate milestones with the team in a laid-back setting. Events like these showed me how much Lennox values its people—not just as professionals, but as individuals.</p>

            <h2>Walking Away with More Than Code</h2>
            <p>As I look ahead, I carry with me much more than technical skills. I've learned how to collaborate deeply across disciplines, deploy machine learning models in constrained environments, and build AI systems that are both useful and usable. I've seen what it's like to be part of a team that's pushing boundaries—and bringing real innovation into people's homes.</p>

            <p>A huge thank you to Sridhar Venkatesh for being an incredible mentor and to Hanif Ansari, Prasad Mecheri Chandravihar, Kristin, Pranav, Lavina, Hemashruthi, Palaniappan, Kriti, and so many others for making this experience unforgettable.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Lennox International, for a summer that was equal parts learning, building, laughing, and growing. This is only the beginning.</p>
